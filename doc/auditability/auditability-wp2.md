    - going through questionnaire

## 1) General
- **General current description of the task solved by the WP and connection to the other WPs (main components, data flows, processing steps, inputs and outputs, supporting services/libraries)?**
- **What would be the outputs(s) of the WP? (e.g.: ML model, datasets, application, results,....)**
- **Who are the main stakeholders of the designed system from your point of view? (creators, users, involved/affected parties,...)**
- **What will be the main activities of the WP/system? (e.g processing steps, components)**
